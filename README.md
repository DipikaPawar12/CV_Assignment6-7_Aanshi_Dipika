## Introduction
---    
In the past, for creating an image in a particular style and form, people used to have need of specialised artist and spend lot of time and money for that. Since last few decades, even computer researchers have taken a keen interest in this field and have developed techniques like non-photorealistic rendering(NPR) which can only be used for a limited number of styles, image analogies for a style transfer by differentiating the stylized and unstylized images.The most recent method of neural style transfer using convolutional neural network is the most prominent one. Neural Style Transfer(NST) works on the idea that a CNN can separate the style and content representation within an image during a task(specifically computer vision task). By taking in two input images, style image and content image and then forming an output image that has the content of the content image but the style of the style image.

## Installation guidelines
---
- To clone this repository
 ```
git clone https://github.com/DipikaPawar12/CV_Assignment6-7_Aanshi_Dipika.git
 ```
- To install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- To mount the drive 
```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
- For content and style images(i.e. source and target image),
  - Either use images of the images folder
  - Or search for another images online
